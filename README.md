Introduction   
---  
Due to rigid materials, there are some problems, such as hard, non-scalable, etc. The softhand project uses flexible materials to achieve the simulation of the opponent, and adds some additional functions, for example visual recognition of handwritten numberals, flexible hand to make the corresponding gestures.The related review can be referred to :[Flexible Robot References][Flexible robot references]

Targets   
---  
In the project, we mainly achieve the following goals:  
1. Realize manual control of flexible gripper  
2. Realize the control of the upper computer to the flexible gripper  
3. Realize manually the digital display of the number 1 to 5 in the upper comuter  
4. Realize flexible grippers to grasp different objects  
5. Realize visual recognition of handwritten digits, flexible hands showing corresponding gestures   


***  
Design   
---  
The softhand project is mainly divided into four parts:  
1. Making flexible hand body  
2. Hardware circuit design  
3. The host computer interface preparation  
4. Handwritten digit recognition  

### Making flexible hand body   
We adopt the air-actuated method. The subject material of the actuator is made of silicone and disigned usign PN(PneuNets) structure.
